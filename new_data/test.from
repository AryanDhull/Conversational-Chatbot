Search the City.  Best or Worst?  I'll never say.
Whoa, that sounds awesome! Mighty is always a good time anyways. Stuck down in the peninsula though. Enjoy!
I'm installing Age of Chivalry and Tera as we speak, but my DSL is oudated and shit.
In all fairness, he would have been in extreme pain with that break. It's highly likely he spent a fair bit of time passing out from the pain. He did well to move himself at all.

Yes, we are attacking tourists at airports.
Not trying to bad talk my own team, but I think Mike Smith is a huge reason why we're doing well. We have a lot of talent on offense, and some on defense, but that really wouldn't matter without Coach Smith.

That I131 shit is radioactive. No kissing. Flushing twice. WITH the lid down and no sex. DAMN. 
Then we will become the fun police on a generation hooked on a new technology. The cycle will continue as it always has.
I also used to write 'I hat dad hes men to me' in pen on the walls, I was trying to write 'I hate dad he's mean to me'. He still teases me to this day.
