Oh yes. She took out Catherine and Grimsley. And Hydreigon in all OHKO.
Yeah, I found out about it from nubmer. He seemed confused as to why I was there also. 
and zaba can play down the left if need be. Him and Rafael are the only right backs to really do well this season so far though.
I feel like this thread isn't quite long enough...
There are some good reasons why he probably won't end up at Spurs, but I doubt being an Arsenal fan will have anything to do with it.
He made it with his label, Fool's Gold, but gave it away for free, so it's a mixtape. I believe the deluxe edition is one you have to pay for though.
Its ignorance in a sense that we've lost our ways in the last 100-200 years. Went from a hunter-gatherer/farmer type of living to this mass produced glucose stuff everyone's been eating for the last 60 years.
Shes a Hobbit obviously
Exactly. :)
You guys have a fucking HUG?!
Amen. Customers at Kohls would always get pissed because Kohls cash would be applied BEFORE a percent off coupon. I've seen so many customers screaming at cashiers about it and it's really sad because we can't do anything! 
You're welcome :)

Those. Bastards. 
How did this thread go from toothpaste to math
Schedule better opponents obviously!
But but... there are no cows in Inaba... Fish maybe but no cows. 
True that - I completely forgot about that travesty, ugh. Though if we want to go down that route, the worst possible game Nate Kaeding's enemies could have ever wished for him cost us an additional playoff game under Norv.

Aim surplus. Bought 500 rounds at that price a month or so ago. Great ammo for the price. Cheaper to shoot my ar than my 9mm   newlinechar  newlinechar However a check of their site shows it's persistenly out of stock and increased in price now.

Well, I plan on sobering up quite a bit. 
Wow, just tried this out on myself from two different TTYs and this is pretty cool. If only I had access to someone's box to talk to. :-(
Whoops my mistake. Always thought that was so confusing though. 
Awesome! Thanks heaps guys. 
Okay I know the website, I just didn't know about the Mod manager thingy . You sir, get an upvote for being helpful.
And is currently making a tabletop game. 
Well since you fessed up and saved us the trouble, you get a pass from the Brotherhood of Comic Sans!
Yeah, but 2 things 1) It's a dash, not a blink and 2) no skill corki has lowers the CD of Valkyrie. A dash is not nearly as safe. Taric stuns Corki, he stops dashing, he stuns Ez, he still blinks away.
You all get upvotes
He also drafted Tebow. *In the first round.*

I just bought a quilted jacket that fits like that — fine in the shoulders, big in the waist (I'm athletic).  What's the best way to fix this and how much does it cost?
Did you read the design article on the mothership?  They said that they sat down to design cards for Gatecrash and the two cards that got designed and later added to RtR instead were: newlinechar  newlinechar Search the City newlinechar  newlinechar Urban Burgeoning
Sorry you can't make it! Hope you have a great evening/morning whatever you wind up doing. :)
bro do you even steam sale? 
also aren't corn fields REALLY hard to walk through already? Also he had to get out of a creek. Also he has to find food, water...
You've been waiting all day to say that, haven't you? 
dont know how ou do it
The solution to many of life's problems is to throw a bear at it.
Because I'm used to using thumbs to control, I sometimes turn Num Lock off and put my left thumb on A and put my right on Numpad 6 and hold the keyboard as if it was an iPad. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't try this at home.

Tried that. Said it was already installed. I should have said that I've already beat the campaign, I'm a level 58, had the game since day one. I've tried all the obvious things, and it only does it with 'Dawn'......I appreciate the ideas and effort though. Happy New Year
That is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
good enough :)!
I bet ctusk423 probably struck oil digging this here hole for himself.
It would definitely be interesting to see what new platforms they come up with. 
I'm in the same boat as you, and and see mailing lists as a time sucking energy drain. However, and mailing lists using client rule sets are easier to mold to how a user would like to use them than a forum.
What sort of boosting, because I'm thinking about doing a ghetto g60 rig in mine and i'm wondering what sort of induction to go with
Thanks. I will give this a shot next time I go to clean the machine!
Do you live in Phoenix?  I saw almost the same thing a few weeks ago.
Usually /u/C9B posts them every friday, but I assume since it's a 'holiday' it's ok. As for your outfit everything fits nicely but I don't like that shirt.
Now, I'm officially jealous. They made the unfortunate decision about ten years ago to rework the art with muddier colors in a misguided attempt to 'appeal to an American audience.' As if we couldn't handle pink, orange, and yellow.
